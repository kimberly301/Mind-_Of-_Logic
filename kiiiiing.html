<h1> The world is yours</h1>
King Boo
<h2>Yes it is</h2>
Hello to all kings
<h6>Final</h6>



<p> I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, , I run it
Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted
While the rest of 'em just worry about  and getting blunted
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1
Only difference is I'm stronger and better from when I've begun
So when people that never knew me they tell me that I changed
That my music is different and my vision's rearranged?
I just stop, and do my best to refrain
From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane
Will I die? Will I live?
Give the world everything I have to give
This is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age
Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage
Even though it's in the millions that shit don't define my brilliance
Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions
Of people that separated, but all equal
To know the ending one must understand the prequel
I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seep in 'em like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer
Even though heaven sent him
Spit it like Holy water, prophetically repent 'em then we gone </p>
